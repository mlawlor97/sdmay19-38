# Android App Forensic Evidence Database

Tool designed to minimize time forensic investigators must spend to find data on an Android Device.

In order to build the tool, we designed a database along with (currently 3) web-crawlers to compile a complete list of every Android application along with what data it stores and where it stores it on the device.
