	Description:   WhatsApp Messenger is the most convenient way of quickly sending messages on your mobile phone to any contact or friend on your contacts list. The only requirement is that the other people must have the app installed on their own device.  Currently, WhatsApp is compatible with just about all mobile operating systems on the market: Android, iOS, Symbian and Windows Phone. So this basically means youâ€™ll be able to use WhatsApp to communicate with any friend, regardless of what model of device they have.  WhatsApp users can send text messages, voice messages, links and images to any other user. Automatic image compression makes transferring files very easy (although there is obviously some quality loss).  One of the most interesting and most used tools on WhatsApp is the one that lets you easily create and manage groups. Any user can enter any group, as long as theyâ€™ve been invited by the groupâ€™s creator, and they can leave it whenever they want.  WhatsApp is the perfect communication tool for Android users because with it, you can forget about paying for text messages ever again. Itâ€™s also important to keep in mind that WhatsApp is fully compatible with WhatsApp PLUS (in so far as sending and receiving messages is concerned).

	Description:   Facebook is the official Android app for the iconic original social network <i>par excellence</i>. Once again, this app is here to simplify your Facebook experience by providing all your favorite features from one spot.   Essentially, this Facebook app has all the same features as its original browser version, the only main difference you'll notice is that you can't play Facebook games on it.   That said, gaming aside, you'll get all the same updates from friends and family; browse your timeline, upload and save photos, change your status, comment and the whole lot -- from anywhere.   One of the best features of this official Facebook app is the option to share all kinds of content directly from your smartphone. You can upload photos and videos straight from your gallery directly onto your Facebook account.   Facebook for Android is truly a must-have app for anyone that's fairly active on the world's #1 social network. Albeit, it does come with a single (but major) setback. You cannot access your Facebook direct messages from this app, but rather, you'll have to go the extra mile and download Facebook's fully independent Messenger app (also on Uptodown) in order to check your Facebook messages from your smartphone.
