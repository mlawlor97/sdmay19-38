	Description:   WhatsApp Messenger is the most convenient way of quickly sending  messages on your mobile phone to any contact or friend on your contacts  list. The only requirement is that the other people must have the app  installed on their own device.  Currently, WhatsApp is compatible with just about all mobile operating  systems on the market: Android, iOS, Symbian and Windows Phone. So this  basically means youâ€™ll be able to use WhatsApp to communicate with any  friend, regardless of what model of device they have.  WhatsApp users can send text messages, voice messages, links and images  to any other user. Automatic image compression makes transferring files  very easy (although there is obviously some quality loss).  One of the most interesting and most used tools on WhatsApp is the one  that lets you easily create and manage groups. Any user can enter any  group, as long as theyâ€™ve been invited by the groupâ€™s creator, and they  can leave it whenever they want.  WhatsApp is the perfect communication tool for Android users because  with it, you can forget about paying for text messages ever again. Itâ€™s  also important to keep in mind that WhatsApp is fully compatible with  WhatsApp PLUS (in so far as sending and receiving messages is  concerned).

	Description:   Facebook is the official Android app for the iconic original social network <i>par excellence</i>. Once again, this app is here to simplify your Facebook experience by providing all your favorite features from one spot.   Essentially, this Facebook app has all the same features as its original  browser version, the only main difference you'll notice is that you  can't play Facebook games on it.   That said, gaming aside, you'll get all the same updates from friends  and family; browse your timeline, upload and save photos, change your  status, comment and the whole lot -- from anywhere.   One of the best features of this official Facebook app is the option to  share all kinds of content directly from your smartphone. You can upload  photos and videos straight from your gallery directly onto your  Facebook account.   Facebook for Android is truly a must-have app for anyone that's fairly  active on the world's #1 social network. Albeit, it does come with a  single (but major) setback. You cannot access your Facebook direct  messages from this app, but rather, you'll have to go the extra mile and  download Facebook's fully independent Messenger app (also on Uptodown)  in order to check your Facebook messages from your smartphone.

	Description:   Gmail is the official app for the Google email client that lets you  manage you email account (and any other account you may have) using a  clean and user-friendly interface.  The first thing users will note is that, apart from having your regular  email account, you can also associate other, different accounts to the  app. Thanks to this feature youâ€™ll be able to get all of your emails in a  single place, without having to resort to any other email manager.  Gmailâ€™s interface is very similar to the desktop browser client which  just about all users are already use to: on the left column you have  different tags and categories, while in the center of the screen you get  to read all of your emails. Gmailâ€™s intelligent management system also  separates promotions, from social emails, and both of these from the  truly important emails.  Thanks to the all of the widgets installed in the Gmail app, you can  monitor email tags on your deviceâ€™s main screen, or simply see your  latest incoming emails (and answer them if you want).  Gmailâ€™s official app is, like its desktop version, a must-have service  for any regular Android user. There may be better ways of managing your  email from a mobile device, but finding them wonâ€™t be easy.
